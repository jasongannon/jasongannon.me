# Jason Gannon's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, which includes my resume, blog, and other information.

## Development

This project uses Astro as the web framework, with TypeScript for the blog posts.

To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, you can install the dependencies and start the development server with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
