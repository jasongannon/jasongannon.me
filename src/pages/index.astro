 I'm a technical writer and software developer with 15 years of industry experience. During my career, I've had the good fortune to work
      on some great projects with great teams, watch tools and languages
      continue to evolve, and watch the explosion of RESTful APIs and
      microservices architectures.</p><p> 
      technical writing â€” that is my first and best skill and the one I've been
      honing since university. I'm well versed in the tools and methodologies
      needed to build great documentation. Topics like style and usage,
      technical editing, working with SMEs, and information architecture are
      right in my wheelhouse. I am a also a decent to very good front-end
      developer and I can operate in a writer/developer role (I usually do). ###
      How I Like to Work I'm a proponent of the [Docs as
      Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach. Plain
      text, version control, and automation all make the technical writer's life
      easier and less error prone. I, like many tech writers, love Markdown. I
      like to work in a text editor and a terminal ([VS
      Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and
      [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is a great setup). ### What I'm Up to
      Lately Nowadays, I focus on the methods and tools that help build great
      developer documentation: docs as code, developer portals, API references,
      internal team sites. So I'm often trying out a new documentation tool or
      researching other developer portals to see what the best-in-class sites
      are offering to developers. I enjoy study and I love software and
      hardware, so I'm happy to deep-dive into a new tool or topic needed for
      work. And I love film, books, music, coffee, travel, history, philosophy.
      (But, hey, who doesn't?)
