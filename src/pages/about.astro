      <p>
        I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
        page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
      </p>

      <p>
        This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep
        checking back and see how my journey is going!
      </p>
      <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName} {identity.lastName}.</li>
        <li>
          I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
        </li>
        {
          identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
            <li>
              My hobbies include {identity.hobbies[0]}, {identity.hobbies[1]},
              and {identity.hobbies[2]}
            </li>
          )
        }
      </ul>
      <p>My skills include:</p>
      <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </section>
